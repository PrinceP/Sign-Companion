There are only few sign language school, and even then not everyone can afford to attend them.</p> <p>Teachers interact with students through pictures on the wall. This creates a lot of friction from word to word, they also copy the expression, and signs as is, and don't understand the meaning behind it. Learning sign language requires a lot of patience and attention, which is not possible with the current infrastructure.</p> <p>The use of oral communication with deaf-mute people is still prevalent. There is a huge gap between formal education and informal communication. Even parents use either oral expressions or an entirely different sign language while the kid is growing.</p> <p>Use of oral expressions, and learning wrong sign language results in most of the people communicating with only single words. And even after completing their schooling and college, they are still unemployable. The one that gets employed, don't have access to good infrastructure to support them, in terms of communication, and education.</p> <p>The consequence is that, millions of people from deaf-mute community are not able to complete their education, get a job, or even communicate properly.</p>"},{"location":"#what-are-we-doing","title":"What are we doing?","text":"<p>We are making an app, Leepi( \u0932\u093f\u092a\u093f ) that helps people learn sign language.
